Stress has all kinds of negative effects in our lives. It can even effect things like how you digest food. When I worked for Diply.com I had terrible digestive issues for almost my entire time there. My stomach was bloated, gassy, and sore almost every day. I was trying to figure out what was causing the issue. I cut out dairy. I tried cutting out wheat. I kept a food diary. I had settled on figuring that I had a sensitivity to too much fiber and cut out things like apples, which I loooove. Even then, even when I was careful, I still would have days that hurt. 

I hated it. It impeded on sex. It made me just want to get home and change into pajamas right away because pants hurt too much. It made me not want to go out. It was embarrassing. 

When I quit from Diply to be a freelance writer, I continued to eat the things that I always ate, but realized quickly that my stomach was fine. No pain. No bloating. No gas. Nothing. Cautiously, I started re-introducing the foods that I had cut out of my diet. Still, no pain. 

I racked my brain for what could possibly be different. I was still getting up and doing the same routine as before. I was eating the same foods. The only change in my life was the change in my job. After doing a little research I was smacked across the face with the truth: stress had been affecting how my body was digesting food. 

After realizing how much of a toll stress can take physically on your body I decided to develop some methods to take pauses through out the week and de-stress. Even if I'm not feeling stress, I still keep up with these de-stressing methods because it can be hard to pinpoint stress until it shows up. And preventative care is always preferable to waiting for a problem to show up. 

Here are a few easy things that can help you fend off stress through out the week that is easy to add to your self-care routine. 

## A walk in nature

There is absolutely nothing that cuts through stress for me like a walk in nature. I happen to live right across from protected green space with a path for walking. I like to take morning or evening walks at least a few times a week through there to clear my head and breathe in the scent of bushes, flowers, and trees. 

If you have a garden, park, or forested area close by, try to work it in to your routine to walk through it a few times a week. It can work wonders. 

Make sure to keep your thoughts onto soothing things. I like to think about my last date night. Or think of fond childhood memories. Or re-live my favorite vacations. Sometimes I simply think about what fun things I want to do on the weekend. Keep any to-do lists, any work-thoughts, or anything that causes you to start to plan or fret out of your mind.

## Head to water

Whether it's fountains, a river, a lake, or any kind that flows, the sound of water is so tranquil. You can't help but feel your shoulders get less tense when you hear moving water trickling or rushing or splashing. 

If you can get a little fountain for your home to set up in a quiet corner, then that's a great spot for you to take some time for yourself through out the week. Try sitting there and taking in five deep breaths with your eyes closed. You'll start to feel tension leave and peace set in.

## Music soothes the soul

Music has a way of consuming all of you. It's magical in the way that it reverberates through your body and soul and can instantly change your mood. I have a soothing playlist on my Spotify that I put on anytime I want peace and tranquility. It centers me and takes away all thoughts of work and worries. 

For me de-stressing music needs to be wordless. If you've never looked for that kind of music, I would suggest checking out these artists: Cloudkicker and Caspian. They make BEAUTIFUL music that will transport you and help to get you out of your head and into the moment. 

To help get this into your routine, try working a soothing song or two into your regular routine at least a few times a week. You could take some extra time in the morning when you're getting ready for work, just five extra minutes, and sit somewhere comfy while you listen. Or, take a walk and listen in the evenings. Maybe when you pull in to your house after work, turn the car off, put in some headphones, and stay in the car while you listen to a song and breathe deeply. Maybe when you get ready for bed at night you throw the song on and sit on the edge of the tub listening.

## Tea and a comfy chair

Holding a giant mug of hot tea to sip is one of my favorite things. Even just holding it to your face and breathing in the aroma has tranquil properties. The steam from the tea warms your face and you inhale rich and soothing scents. 

Sipping tea is anywhere from 5-10 minutes. I like to have uninterrupted tea time. For me, if I have a cup of tea in my hands, that means do not bother me. Do not come and ask me questions. Do not make me make decisions. Tea time is me time. 

When you're winding down for bedtime or when you're getting up in the morning, give yourself a bit of extra time and take that time to sip some hot tea in your most comfortable chair in the house. Make it a rule in your household that no one interrupts you when you're in that chair with your favorite mug and your tea. Establishing those rules right away will help in the long run.

## Bubbles and lots of them

In the winter time, this is my go-to way to de-stresser since the great outdoors is much more limited to me. Bubble baths are basically the embodiment of having zero stress. Fill your tub up with hot water and a mountain of bubbles that smell like a spa or some kind of delicious dessert (whatever you prefer) and soak until you're wrinkled and so relaxed that you feel like you're on cloud nine. 

While this is harder to make a regular thing, try blocking out that me-time to once a week at a regular time. Put it in your calendar. Seriously. Do it. Put it in your calendar so that you remember and so that you're more likely to actually do it. Once you make it a habit, it will become part of your routine and you'll start to really look forward to that half hour of de-stressing.

## Face mask and a foot soak

Face masks, especially ones with natural ingredients, are great to incorporate into your skincare routine, so why not make it a double whammy. You can do something good for your skin and your mental health. 

Apply your face mask, and while you need to wait for it to do its magic, soak your feet in a large container filled with hot water. You can add in Epson salts or essential oils if you want. Sit there and let yourself feel pampered. Block out any thoughts and just sit there, breathing, and enjoying the moment. 

Once your face mask is ready to be washed off you'll be feeling relaxed and de-stressed!

Finding ways to fit these methods into your daily routine and making them into habits is a great tool to have in your mental health arsenal. After all, if you get in the habit of doing it now, when stressful times hit, you're already in a great position to deal with it.
