I love watching food shows. I think that if I had to choose one genre and one genre only of television and had to get rid of the rest, I would choose food shows. Competitions, cooking shows, I love them all. For competition shows I love thinking about what I would do to complete the challenge. I'm right there with the contestants and I love every minute of it.

I also love (and by love I mean am so obsessed with, I should probably re-examine my life choices) desserts and baking. I'm pretty damn proud of my cheesecake and have a go-to recipe that is pretty much memorized by now for cookies, brownies, cakes and scones. 

I'm also a millennial, which means that I have an unhealthy love of epic fails. Watching someone try really hard only to have it end disastrously makes up like 1/4 of my daily humor. Reddit [fails](https://www.reddit.com/r/fail/), anyone?

So you would think that a TV show that is a baking competition that is basically a show where people try to re-create dessert masterpieces only to have it fail in epic proportions would be my favorite show of all time. You'd think. 

There's this show on Netflix called [_Nailed It!_](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80179138)_ _where the contests play for a chance to win $10,000 by trying to re-create stunning desserts. It sounded perfect for me. The show itself was fun. Like any food competition show they make sure to choose contestants that have personality and who are thoroughly entertaining.

You get to see beautiful creations and you also get to see the contestants totally blow their re-creations. It's cute. It's funny. It's entertaining. BUT I hate the show. Why? The host.

The host is this bubbly, loud, vivacious woman that I cannot stand. She's too much. She takes away from the show. It feels like she wants to **_be_** the show, rather than be on the show.

I've tried to watch the show and just ignore her but I can't. The host is such an essential part of the whole experience that there is no way to ignore them and just enjoy the show.
