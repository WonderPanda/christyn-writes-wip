  Uber Eats was having a free delivery promotion and we caved. Somehow that
  ended up in a long conversation about being intentional. This is how.

It started with a promotion from Uber Eats for free delivery. 

Jesse and I use a budgeting app called You Need A Budget (YNAB). The idea is a zero-based budgeting system, which is a fancy way of saying that every dollar that comes in, you assign to a budget. So all of your money is accounted for and all of it has a purpose. This budgeting app also means that if you overspend in one category, you have to cover it from taking away to another category. It helps to keep us on track because when you over spend on your "eating out" budget and need to take from your "vacation budget", you really feel it.

So, it was a Wednesday Night and Jesse and I were really feeling the "hump day blues". It was the middle of the month and we had a few days coming up where we knew we would be using the "eating out" category, and it was already running low. Ordering in and the free delivery from Uber Eats was calling to us.

Jesse suggested ordering sushi, but of course, we knew that using our "eating out" budget was not an option. I suggested that we could have a sushi date. So Jesse went down into the cold room and grabbed a bottle of white wine to pop into the freezer and we ordered our usual.

Normally date night at home includes wine, delicious foods, cuddling on the couch while watching something fun, and no phones. We got the food in and sat down to eat it. We put on something that we didn't really care about, got distracted having to put up the curtains when the cat pulled them down, and spent the majority of the night on our phones. 

The entire night went by without actually connecting. Our "date night" had become an excuse to order in food and go around the budget. But the thing is that we usually put thought into making sure that each month we fully spend our date night budget to make sure that we're having those nights of connecting with one another and keeping the romance stoked. 

The next day Jesse brought it up. We had spent an entire night separated and disconnected from each other when it was supposed to be our date night, our night to connect. To be honest, it even ended without the bedtime fun. What kind of a date night is that?

That when we decided that we need to be more intentional with our lives. If we're going to have a date, we're going to be intentional about it. We're going to make a conscious decision to connect emotionally, physically, and mentally. We're not going to use it as an excuse to trick the budget. We're going to spend those dollars budgeted on nights where we enjoy each other's company and keep the romance alive and well in our relationship. 

Intentionality can move beyond date night. We decided that we would be intentional with time, making sure that our time is being spent on something that is positive in our lives: working, being active, reading, enjoying hobbies, or bonding with important people in our lives.

We also decided that we would be intentional in our relationships. I don't want to waste my time with people who do not add anything to my life. I want to spend my time with people who are positive influences. People who care about me. People who help me to be everything that I want to be in life. 

Life can pass you by while you sit around trying to decide what to do. People can suck up your time with relationships that don't add any value to your life. If you're not intentional with who you spend your time with and what you spend your time doing, then your life can just pass by without you having lived. 

Ask yourself what areas in your life you want to be more intentional in. Maybe it's your spending. Maybe it's your free-time. Maybe it's your own date nights. Figure out what it is and make a commitment to be in the moment and mindful in your life.
