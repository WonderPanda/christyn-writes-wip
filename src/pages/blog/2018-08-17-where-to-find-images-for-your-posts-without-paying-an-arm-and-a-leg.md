It's pretty common knowledge that when it comes to blogs, images are so important. Most people are going to be reading your blog on their phone, and there is nothing as tiring and looking at large chunks of text on the screen as you scroll without anything interesting for the eye.

But, of course, when it comes to photos there are always licensing issues to be aware of. Your absolute best option is original images because you own them. If you do have a good camera, I seriously suggest this. There are a lot of tools out there for editing photos, so you can make your photos look professional pretty easily. 

If you're like me and you have a pretty crappy camera on your phone (I believe when I originally was choosing the phone I said something along the lines of "I don't need a good camera" and what a fool I was), then you're going to need to use other means. 

Here are some options for you.  

_Before I go on, I need to interrupt here. As I mentioned in my first post, I'm "doing this live" with you. So as I learn things, I'm writing about them for you. I'll admit that my photo game in articles still needs work. Sometimes I put in an image that isn't really what I wanted to put in simply because I couldn't find what I wanted. But I'm learning and getting better. These tools are what I've been able to learn from and what is taking me to the next level, no matter how slowly._

## **Google, with filters**

When you go to search for images on google, they've actually made it easy for you to find images that have usage rights to suit your needs. Once you search for whatever you're looking for, click on the tools button. Then click on "usage rights". There a menu will drop down which can let you select what kind of usage rights will suit you. The usage rights will depend on if you can make money off of whatever you're using the image for and whether or not you'll be modifying the image in any sense.

## Free stock images

Stock images can be one of your best bets. You can find almost anything you're looking for in stock images. Once you get a little more settled and start bringing in an income that you're comfortable with, you can start buying image subscriptions to invest back into your work. That will really open up the options for you and give you the widest range of possibility. Before that happens, free stock images will be your go-to. Here are some of the ones I've had experience with.

[**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com/) - the amount of images that you have to choose from here is amazing. There are a lot of images here that are beautiful. They feel more artistic than the standard stock image. They don't require you to source the photographer, but provide the name in case you can mention them. 

[**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/photos/free/) - If you don't have a Canva account already, I totally recommend getting one. It's a great way to make different Social Media posts, you can modify images easily, and they also have free stock images. Although I will say that while you're exploring the free images, you're likely to run across their stock images that are for purchase and those tend to be much nicer. So you're always seeing greener grass across the fence. 

[**Gratisography**](https://gratisography.com/) - There is a much smaller pool to pick from here, but the amazing thing about this site is that they have much more unique images. These are not the kind of images that you're going to find on a regular stock image site. 

[**Pixabay**](https://pixabay.com/en/) - They have a good amount of images, depending on what it is that you're looking for, but if you start to get too specific, you might be disappointed.

[**Pexels**](https://www.pexels.com/) - You're going to find that this site has a similar feel to Pixabay. I usually bounce between these two when I'm looking for a good stock image. 

[**Stockvault**](https://www.stockvault.net/#) - What I love best about this site is the categories that they offer at the top. There are just so many to choose from and more categories than you could think of yourself. 

[**Picjumbo**](https://picjumbo.com/) - There are a lots of great images on this site, and I like that you can search terms like "freelance" and get a plethora of choices. The one thing about this site that can be tricky is that their ads sometimes look like part of the site. I've clicked on them accidentally myself. 

## The meme option

Memes are one of those grey areas on the internet. The whole idea of a meme is for it to be sharedâ€”that's the very nature of the meme. As long as you're not trying to make money off of a meme by using it as an ad, then there can be an argument that they are fair game. Plus, if you make the meme yourself, then you've modified it which makes it something new and different. If you do choose to use meme-type images on your blog, make sure to read up on the legality of it first. I've done so for myself so that I feel comfortable using memes in the way that I do. This is a practice that I recommend in general. Always check out the legality of things for yourself and don't just take the word of a blog you've read. No matter how helpful we try to be. ;)

So! Go forth and fill your blog with wonderful images. Whether they are images you took, images you found on google, stock images, or memes, you'll be able to use images knowing that you're doing everything right that you should when it comes to copy write laws.
